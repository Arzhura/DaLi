# DaLi

## Context 
DaLi stands for Data Life in the context of data life cycle genomics. 
It is a proposal based on a consensus among scientists that I aimed to reproduce in a UML flowchart. 
Two main articles support this proposition (see References). The ten Hoopen et al. article provides a general overview of methods to ensure best practices for omics data, intending a more FAIR implementation. The Dardaillon et al. article is more specific and applies to a typical use case encountered in marine genomics.
